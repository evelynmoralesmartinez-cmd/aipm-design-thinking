# Design Thinking

This repository is a Markdown-based learning path for using Design Thinking as
a practical product discovery and problem-solving approach. Participants move
from understanding design processes to evidence-based empathy, problem framing,
ideation, prototyping, testing, and iteration. They then configure Claude Code
with a reusable Skill and focused subagents so the agent can produce most of the
artifacts while the AI Project Manager owns evidence and decisions.

## Project at a Glance

The project follows one evidence-driven learning cycle from an original user
challenge to a tested concept, with Claude Code producing artifacts under PM
direction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this repository, you should be able to:

- Explain why product teams use structured design processes.
- Distinguish Design Thinking, the Double Diamond, and a timeboxed design sprint.
- Investigate user needs through observations, interviews, existing evidence, and
  clearly labelled assumptions.
- Create an evidence-backed persona and a focused user journey map.
- Turn research insights into a problem statement, point of view, and How Might
  We question.
- Generate and select ideas without jumping too quickly to a feature.
- Build a prototype whose fidelity matches the learning question.
- Plan and run a lightweight usability test, then use evidence to iterate.
- Connect a journey map to user stories and a small story map.
- Explain the difference between a Claude Code Skill and a subagent.
- Create a project Skill that turns the Design Thinking method into a reusable
  workflow.
- Use focused subagents to audit evidence and review a prototype without
  presenting simulated opinions as user research.
- Evaluate and improve a Skill or subagent after observing how it influences
  Claude Code's work.
- Delegate artifact creation and prototype iteration while keeping evidence and
  human decisions in control.

## Learning Path

The modules build on each other in order.

| File / Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| [**01 - Design Processes and Design Thinking**](01-design-processes-and-design-thinking.md) | Understand the purpose of design processes and compare Design Thinking with the Double Diamond and design sprints. |
| [**02 - Empathise with Evidence**](02-empathise-with-evidence.md) | Gather evidence about users and turn it into a persona and journey map without confusing assumptions with facts. |
| [**03 - Define and Ideate**](03-define-and-ideate.md) | Synthesize research into a focused problem frame, then generate and select possible responses. |
| [**04 - Prototype, Test, and Iterate**](04-prototype-test-and-iterate.md) | Choose prototype fidelity, run a useful test, and make the next learning cycle explicit. |
| [**05 - Claude Code Skills and Subagents**](05-claude-code-skills-and-subagents.md) | Turn the Design Thinking method into a reusable Skill and delegate focused review work to isolated subagents. |
| [**06 - Session Handout**](06-session-handout.md) | Choose an original challenge, direct Claude Code through a complete Design Thinking cycle, and use optional extensions for deeper agent and product work. |

### Additional Folders and Files

## Getting Started

No Python environment is required for this repository.

1. Open Claude Code using any available interface, such as the VS Code
   extension, CLI, desktop application, or another graphical interface, and
   make the project files available to it.
2. Open `README.md`.
3. Read the lesson files in numerical order.
4. Use the session handout for the practical workshop.
5. Use Claude Code through your chosen interface when the handout introduces
   the agent workflow.
6. Keep a clear separation between direct evidence, interpretation, and open
   questions in every deliverable.

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

Claude Code can structure notes, challenge a problem statement, produce
artifacts, build a prototype, and implement an approved iteration. AI output is
not user evidence. Do not enter sensitive personal data into an AI tool.
Remove names and identifying details from research notes before sharing them
with Claude Code. Keep a short collaboration log containing the request, what
Claude produced, what was verified, and what the team accepted, edited, or
rejected.
